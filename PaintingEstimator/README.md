## Shaun Timothee

### Assignment 3 Requirements:

*Painting Estimator*

1. Calculate home interior paint cost
2. Must use float data type
3. Must use SQFT_PER_GALLON constant (350).
4. Must use iteration structure (aka "loop").
5. Format right-aligh numbers, and round to two decimals places.
6. Create at least five functions that are called by the program:
        a. main(): calls two other functions: get_requirements() and estimate_painting_cost()
        b. get_requirements(): displays the program requirements.
        c. estimate_painting_cost(): calculates interior home painting, and calls print functions.
        d. print_painting_estimate(): displays painting costs.
        e. print_painting_percentage(): displays painting costs percentages.
